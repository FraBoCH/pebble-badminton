# Pebble Badminton Score

An easy to use pebble app to count the points during your badminton game. Hit the bottom button when you score, the top button when your opponent scores. The final score will be displayed at the end of the match.

This app is an adaptation of [Ben Gourley's Pebble Tennis] (https://github.com/bengourley/pebble-tennis) to the badminton game.
